# Cake Ordering Backend Scaffold

This repository provides a modular Node.js MVC folder structure for the Cake Ordering System. Each directory is pre-created with placeholder files so implementation details can be filled in later.

## Directory Overview

- `src/app.ts` – application bootstrap placeholder
- `src/server.ts` – server entrypoint placeholder
- `src/config/` – environment and logger configuration stubs
- `src/routes/` – API route groupings with versioned structure (`v1`)
- `src/modules/` – feature areas (auth, users, products, carts, orders, custom orders, analytics, payments, notifications, reviews) following the controller-service-repository pattern with DTOs, validators, and routes
- `src/core/` – shared application mechanics (middlewares, errors, validators)
- `src/shared/` – reusable constants, types, providers, and utilities
- `src/database/` – MongoDB models placeholder
- `src/integrations/` – external service integration stubs (payments, notifications)
- `tests/` – unit, integration, and end-to-end testing directories

## Next Steps

1. Populate configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, ESLint/Prettier, Jest) with project-specific settings.
2. Implement module logic within controllers, services, repositories, DTOs, and validators.
3. Wire up middleware, error handling, logging, and event processing in the `core` layer.
4. Connect to the chosen database and define models/migrations.
5. Add integration clients for payment processors, notification services, and authentication providers.
6. Write automated tests across the provided testing directories.

Feel free to adapt the structure to match team conventions or framework preferences.
